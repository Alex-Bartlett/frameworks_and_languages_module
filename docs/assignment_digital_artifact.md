Assignment - Digital Artifact
=============================

Overview
--------

Create a digital artifact. This will be 60% of this module.

* You will demonstrate you can work towards a formal spec and use automated tests to produce a working system to a business specification
* You will use 3 frameworks for 3 separate problem domains (server, client, layout)


Intended Learning Outcomes
--------------------------

* LO 1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing.
* LO 3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework.

Scenario
--------

Freecycle-Inc have a working prototype implementation of their proposed service.

https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module

The repository provides:
* An OpenAPI3 Specification for the server service `openapi.yml`
* Complete working reference implementations
  * This `example_` reference implementations were built with NO frameworks to allow you to critique/understand why frameworks are used (see Assignment Technical Report)
  * `example_server` A complete reference server implementation that runs in a container (you re-create this functionality) 
  * `example_client` A reference client implementation (that uses `example_server` container)
* Automated Tests  
* * These test run as GitHub actions as part of CI
  * `test_server` An automated test container that tests the server implementation's conformance to the OpenAPI3 spec
  * `test_client` A set of browser tests (cypress), to document the expected client/user flows
* Your implementations
  * `./server/` the stub folder for your server container implementation
  * `./client/` the stub folder for your client container implementation


Task
----

* You are to replace the stub `./server/` and `./client/` implementations with new implementations that pass the server and client automated test suites.
* Your solutions must run in containers on CI
* no tests passing == 0 marks
* Your solutions can use any programming language or frameworks as long as the tests pass


Guidance
--------

* It is not required for your server service to have a persistent data model
  * You can use a data persistence model if desired, but There are no extra marks allocated to this
* There is no requirement for any user authentication
* There is no requirement for scale
  * The system will be operating with less than 100 items (pagination is not needed)
* You will be allocated marks for partial solutions (based on tests that pass)
* You are working towards being a professional software engineers. It is expected that you share and discuss your solutions with peers throughout this assignment. 
* It is expected that you document your sources/references for your code (this includes discussions with dates with classmates, url's to stack overflow resources and framework documentation)

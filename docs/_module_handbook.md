MCOMD3PFL Programming Frameworks and Languages - Handbook
=========================================================
 
## Study hours for the module
* Total 200 hours
* Number of contact hour and pattern of delivery: 50 hours 
* Number of hours when students are expected to study independently or amongst peers, with no direct academic contact: 150 hours of Practice learning and independent study

## Module aims
To develop the student’s understanding of the fundamental concepts of Programming Frameworks and Languages. This module supports the Implement and Operate elements of the CDIO model.

## Module learning outcomes
By the end of the module students should be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing
2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform
3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework

## Overview of learning and teaching activities on the module
* This module will use the CDIO educational framework within the context of developing a full-stack web service to a formal business specification using professional software engineering tools. 
* Making use of active learning tools such as project work and self directed problem-based learning, thus equipping computing students with improved technical knowledge of using an engineering tool-chain. 
* The module will be taught using a combination of lectures, computer laboratory based practical workshops and computer laboratory-based seminars.
* Lectures will be used to cover the background theoretical aspects of the module and will, whenever appropriate, make explicit the relationships between theory and practice; and will use practical demonstrations to reinforce fundamental concepts.
* Students will be involved in regular discussions that focus on dissecting and justifying the use of a range of software tooling.
* Students will be expected to self-managed their learning and self select tools to implement a working solution that meets a predefined specification.
* In addition, time will be spent exploring a range of web frameworks. Each framework was created to solve a specific problem.
* Supervised support sessions will provide guidance on the progress of individual projects, commend good work and to identify areas that need improvement.
* Ongoing feedback will be provided throughout the module by a range of automated tests.
* Blackboard and GitHub will be the repository’s for all learning materials.

## Equipment you need to bring to class
* We will be using linux containers to develop and test software
* GitPod will be the recommend online cloud IDE to support your work both on and off campus
    * Some students may wish to setup their own equipment for native development environment

## Assessments

You will be working in own public GitHub forked repository. At the datetime of the deadline a snapshot of your fork will automatically be taken. In addition, You need to formally submit a zip file with the contents of your repository to TurnitIn for a formal audit trail.

### Viva Process

Submissions may be subject to a viva process.
The digital artefact is a proxy for assessing student understanding. For some students, understanding will have already been incrementally demonstrated in sessions.
The purpose of a viva is to verify student understanding. 
In the two weeks following a submission deadline, students may be called to a viva. Student could be asked to demo their solution, describe aspects of it’s functionality and show their workflow.

### Plagiarism detection
It is expected that some code solutions could be shared. Some sharing of solutions is acceptable and normal, only if the developer conversion is referenced as detailed in the assignment guidance.

Plagiarism detection software may be used to produce similarity reports for both code submissions and write-up submissions. These reports could be used as evidence towards academic misconduct.


## Indicative schedule of delivery
The course will consist of 44 hours of workshops with direct tuition and an additional 44 hours of supervised support. 
Totalling of 88 hours of tutor support.
The module will be broken into 11 workshops with 4 hours tuition and an additional 4 hours supervised support. It is expected (but not compulsory) that students use the additional supervised support time to apply the concepts conveys in the morning workshops.

* Monday 26th September
* Monday 3rd October
* Monday 10th October
* Monday 17th October
* Monday 31st October
* ACW
* Monday 7th November
* Monday 14th November
* Monday 21st November
* Monday 28th November
* Monday 5th December
* Monday 12th December

Reminder: 4 hours a week is insufficient to develop the skills necessary to pass this module. 
Student are reminded again that they should be contributing 150 hours of independent study.

## Guidance on how to use independent study time
* You are expected to self-select the languages and frameworks for your assessment implementation.
* At Level 6; The use of the frameworks are your responsibility. You will not be directly instructed how to use one particular framework.
* It is expected that you follow the online tutorials for a range of frameworks to enable to you to compare and contrast language/framework features.
* You should be independently reading, exploring, and experimenting with a range of frameworks throughout the module duration.
* You should be discussing the merits and features of a different frameworks with your peers and citing/references these discussions in code.
* You should be sharing your code and progress openly. This is good practice for all professional and personal projects.

## Referencing system
Your work must be adequately referenced throughout.
In program code; It is good practice to reference code patterns/snippets with url’s within code comments. 
This is useful for future maintainers to follow your thought process. 
It is always important to acknowledge sources of information. It is acceptable to use snippets of other code if referenced and justified correctly.

As this is an engineering report. References will be made with URL's to framework documentation, blogs and articles. (The access date can be inferred with `git blame`)

## Learning Materials/Resources
All learning materials and resources will be provided during the taught sessions and will be made available via the module’s area on Blackboard.

## Reassessment information
Some students may be required to take reassessment for the module, following a decision from a Board of Examiner. 
Do check the Your Guide to Assessment and Award Processes and seek advice from your Personal Academic Tutor if this is the case for you. 
Support from the module team will be available in preparation for the reassessments.

A simplified task can be provided for reassessment.

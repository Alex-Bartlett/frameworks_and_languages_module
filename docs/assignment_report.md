Assignment - Technical Report
----------

### Overview
Create a 1600 word technical report. This will be 40% of this module.

* You will demonstrate your understanding of the frameworks and languages you have used in your _digital artefact_ assignment.
* You will use technically accurate language

| Assignment | Section | Marks (Total 40) |
|---|--------------------------------|---:|
| 2 | Server framework features *3   |  9 |
| 2 | Server language features *2    |  6 |
| 2 | Client framework features *3   |  9 |
| 2 | Client language features *2    |  6 |
| 2 | Critique of framework-less prototype |  4 |
| 2 | Future Recommendations         |  6 |
|   |                                | 40 |

(1600words/40marks) == 40 words per mark. Make a clear point every 40 Words.
Your writing should be short, sharp, technical and meaningful.

### Scenario
* You have been employed by FreeCycle-Inc as a Lead Engineer
* Your role is to technically advise and implement FreeCycle's digital products on web and mobile platforms
* Freecycle-Inc have an existing working prototype for their FreeCycle platform with tests.

### Task
Produce a summary technical report to the business directors (1600 words total)
The report should contain:
* An introduction summary of what this report contains and why it might be useful to business directors and your engineering team
* Describe the features of the frameworks and languages and explain the problem that they are solving:
  * Server framework features *3
  * Server language features *2
  * Client framework features *3
  * Client language features *2
    * Each feature should contain
      * Technical description of the feature (40 words - 1 mark)
      * A code snippet example demonstrating the feature (1 mark)
        * If you can additionally permalink to a snippet in your own code that would be additional supporting evidence
      * Explain the problem-this-is-solving/why/benefits/problems (40 words - 1 mark)
      * Provide link/reference(s) to your source of information about the feature (references do not count towards word count. No reference == No mark)
* A technical critique of why the existing prototype implementation is not fit for business use
  * Server prototype *2 (2 marks)
  * Client prototype *2 (2 marks)
    * each critique should contain
      * A code snippet example demonstrating the feature (1 mark)
      * Explain the this pattern is problematic (40 words - 1 mark)
* Future Technology Suggestions: Consider a 2 year technical expansion/deployment for freecycle-inc
  * Suggest *3 features of other frameworks or tools/technologies that might be useful in expanding the freecycle product
    * description of a feature or tool (40 words - 1 mark)
    * why/benefits/problems with using this (40 words - 1 mark)
    * Provide reference(s) (references do not count towards word count. No reference == No mark)


### Guidance
* Level of Expectation:
  * This task is intended to mimics a genuine task that might be required of you as a software engineer. This is a scenario for a learning exercise and lacks some of nuance of a real problem.
  * Realistically; You are not a lead developer. You are not expected to write this to a true industry standard. You are trying to demonstrate to an external examiner your knowledge and understanding.
* Technical reports heavily used bullet points. You do not need to write in full english paragraphs all the time.
  * Consider 'Lean documentation'
* Your justifications need to be supported with references. Show links to developer documentation, blog articles and case studies that support your technical assessment/recommendations. It is an institutional policy to use Harvard style referencing.


#### Marking Criteria
TODO?
* Quality of justification
  * Wide range of technical and business factors are considered (skills marketplace, lead time, scale, maintainability, deployment)
* Referencing/Supporting Evidence
* Quality of written communication

* A repository has been setup with an existing prototype implementation with working test suites.
* [github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module](https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module)
* Clone this repository and inspect it's functionally.

Module Overview
---------------

<sub>Hint: Take notes .... seriously! ... get a notepad, or open a text document. Get ready!</sub>

TASK: (10min) 
* Find - the module handbook - read
* Whiteboard - What do you think is in this module?

## Module Aims
To develop the studentâ€™s understanding of the fundamental concepts of Programming Frameworks and Languages. 
This module supports the Implement and Operate elements of the CDIO model.

### Intended Learning Outcomes 
By the end of the module students should be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing
2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform
3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework

Whiteboard in half: words to describe
* What is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)?
* What is a [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)?

The sign of an amateur:
> _TECH_XYZ_ is rubbish
This module will help develop an important part of your professional skill-set: 
* The ability to discuss and reason about technology choices

* The ability to use a professional toolchain (CI)
* Understand the basic elements of full stack web development
  

### Definitions

* Language
  * A formal structure to describe machine behaviour
* Framework
  * Inversion of control
    * It calls you, rather than you call it
* Tests
  * Automated
  * Document business requirements/spec
  * Document correct flow

### How will we learn

1. Focus on a business engineering problem with real industry tools
    * Hands-on each week with a range of tools
2. Discussion
    * Real engineers can discuss/reason about technology
    * Pair programming
3. Multiple languages
  * [langauge_reference.html](https://computingteachers.uk/static/langauge_reference.html)

#### Level 6
* Level 4 - You are told what to do
* Level 5 - Supported developing competency in a range of problem domains
* Level 6 - You are able to self direct (with support)

* My role is NOT to have all the answers
* My role is to facilitate your transition towards a skilled professional

Side Note: Employment. Popular languages? Less popular or new languages? Mark scheme 70%+

#### Session Overview - Online/Campus

Task: Look on blackboard at session list

* Each week
    * 09:00 - 13:00 Lab
    * 14:00 - 18:00 Supervised Workshop Support

  * GitPod -> Color Theme -> Dark+ (recommended)

Demo:
* Fork (description)
  * Allow CI
* The IDE
* The Interaction (public port)
* The tests
* GitPod shutdown and startup
  * 50 hours a month free
    * [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - 100 hours with cccu address + cccu id 

1. (Fork and) run the project on GitPod
2. Add an item with the web interface
3. Run the tests
4. Add an item to another persons server
5. Make a commit and see CI

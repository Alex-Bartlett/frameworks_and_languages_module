I have my own old notes about cypress
https://github.com/calaldees/cypress-for-ci

https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/docker#Images
https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/02/run-cypress-with-a-single-docker-command/

The official images seem to have the same reports problem from 3 years ago - maybe some of my old hacks will help

why is cypress/included:8.3.0 3GB!?
